# aerogel-machine-monitoring

This repository is meant to be a place where I'm able to control and keep my
files for a remote monitoring system I have developed for an aerogel machine in
the lab [I currently work on](https://www.colorado.edu/soft-matter-physics/).

## Note

The files hosted here are under active development and have some minor issues.
I expect to keep updating the repository with improvements as well as a detailed
guide on how to use and reproduce it yourself.
